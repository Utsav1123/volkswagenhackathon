# volkswagenhackathon
for the initial prototype we have coded the back end features of machine translation, sentiment annalysis and chatbot.
The machine translation and sentiment analysis uses a LSTM model. In the final product we aim to add attention mechanisms as well as an upragradtiion to the transformer model. The chatbot has been built using the openai API for now which we also intend to upgrade using our own custom transformer model upon collecting data from a custom built datset.
The frot end is inteded to be built usinng html,css, reactjs etc.
